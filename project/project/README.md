#CS50
>This was my final project to conclude the CS50 Introduction to Computer Sciense course.

##Description:
    This project is based on **C++** language **OOP(Object Oriented Programming)** concepts.I have made this project on visual studio 2019.Please run this project on
    Visual studio 2019 for better experience.Concepts like:
-Pointers
-Dynamic memory allocation
-Association
-Aggregation
-Composition
-Polymorphism(Compile Time polymorphism)
-File handling
are used in making this project.

##Structure:
        I have divided the whole project into 3 files which are:
        -Main.cpp
        -Header.cpp
        -Function.cpp

Main.cpp contains the **int main()** function and in order to make it less messy i have placed the function headers in **Headers.h** file and the definations of
those functions in **Function.cpp** file.

##Working:
    This apps basically read data from txt file.I have removed comments from Posts.txt, Pages.txt, Users.txt and Comments.txt files because i have to read data
from them but you can see SocialNetworkUsers, SocialNetworkPages, SocialNetworkPosts, SocialNetworkPosts and SocialNetworkComments files for viewing the same data
but with comment for better understanding.So that, you may know that how data is actually stored in the txt files.

We have declared dynamic arrays of pages, activity, comments and users to read data form files and later on stored them in their classes accordingly.
And then read use that data for accessing the information of any particular user based on txt files.The execution of this project is below.

##Execution:
       When we execute this **Main.cpp** .We will we following text on the console:
As when we store data in arrays we first store at index zero then onwards.So, in accessing data form arrays 0 id is displayed because of that condition for user
having id 1 and similar is in case of posts, pages and comments.
