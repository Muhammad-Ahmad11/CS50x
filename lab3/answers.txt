In Bubble sort,when the number are in a sorted order it takes less time as compared to merge sort or selection sort
because in best case it has to check Omega(n) where n is the count of numbers. So, for sorted order it has the lowest
time and for the worst case it has to check O(n^2) cases which tooks it longer than sorted case.These two conditions
gives me hint that it is Bubble sort in sort1 file.Bubble sort swap values until all values are sorted.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?:

Random:

Merge sort Half the array ,arrange left half ,arrange right half ,combine them both and arrange again.
In both merge sort and selection sort their best and worst cases are same.Like in merge sort,it best case is Omega(n log n)
and worst case is also O(n log n).From here ,we can guess that this can never be Bubble sort,it can be the remaining of
the two.Now,if we check for file contain 50000 numbers then for the best and worst case we have value of  the 234948
approx. while in Selection sort we have to take square of n(50000) which is many times larger than 234948.This is second
hint towards merge sort.Because in selection sort,the time for both random and sorted is same but that may be larger than
values of merge sort.The value 234948 approx. tells us that merge sort is faster than selection sort.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?:
Random:
real    0m11.617s

Reversed:
real    0m11.480s

Sorted:
real    0m11.026s

We have to iterate over every value.
Worst and best case are same we does not know that whether the list is sorted or not
Based on the points stated above,like above sort is merge sort and first one has the shortest time for best case scenario
All the sorting file are tested on 50000 numbers file.Selection sort has Omega(n^2) for best case and O(n^2) for worst
case .When we put 50000 for best case or worst case we get 2.5 billion which means that in both best and worst cases we
have time larger than merge sort.So,this must be selection sort.
